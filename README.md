# This is a home for SE and Customer support scripts for blackduck and polaris related deployment artifacts.

We will be expanding it in the future to have use cases, scripts, hacks, deployment stories, and kustomizations.

This is not officially supported by the Engineering team at Synopsys, but rather, a jointly owned repo to
innovate on deployment and support recipes.

Owners: Viral, Murat.
